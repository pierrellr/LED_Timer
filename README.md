# LED_Timer
Create a timer for lighting LED for few minutes


This timer will be built around a microcontroller Seeed XIAO BLE nRF52840 Sense Seeed Studio (ref RS: 250-0968), a MOSFET IRLML2502TRPBF (ref RS: ) and a current source also known as Driver LED (2-32Vo 0.7A, CI ref RS: 472222).

The circuit will be powerd by 2 AA battery.
