# LED_Timer
Create a timer for lighting LED for few minutes


This timer will be built around a microcontroller Seeed XIAO BLE nRF52840 Sense Seeed Studio https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/ (ref RS: 250-0968), a MOSFET IRLML2502TRPBF (ref RS: ) and a current source also known as Driver LED (DRIVER DE LED, CC/LINÉAIRE, -40 A 125°C ref Farnell 
3482737).

The circuit will be powerd by 2 AA batteries in series for a voltage of 3V.
